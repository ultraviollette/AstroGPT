In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was discovered in the Linux build of the xz utility, specifically within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. This backdoor, introduced by an account under the name "Jia Tan", enabled remote code execution through OpenSSH for attackers possessing a specific Ed448 private key. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-3094, received the highest severity rating with a CVSS score of 10.0.

XZ Utils, which includes the xz program, is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors used in Unix-like systems and Windows. The backdoor was found in a utility that is commonly included in most Linux distributions. Although the compromised versions were in development stages and not widely deployed in production systems, they were present in development versions of major distributions. The discovery was made by software developer Andres Freund on March 29, 2024.

A backdoor in computing is a method that bypasses normal authentication or encryption to gain unauthorized access to a system. It can be used for securing remote access, obtaining privileged information, or corrupting data. The discovery of such vulnerabilities highlights the importance of rigorous security measures and the potential risks of backdoors in software widely used in critical infrastructure.
